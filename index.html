			<p id="aboutMe"> I’m a creative person with a big imagination. I am someone who aims to make people happy and leave their mark on this world through art! Something I’ve always been proud of is my sense of creativity and the variety of ways I’ve been able to show it. As a multimedia artist, I have specialized in painting, digital art, and most importantly, web design and development.  I chose this career path because I am able to put forward all of my talents into one and build on them from the ground up. While I love all of my art forms, I knew I wanted to be a web designer and developer way back when I was younger in the Myspace days where you could edit your page to your liking. Silly, but that’s what has lead me to the path I am taking today! Since then, I have set forward to learn all the skills, languages and any other details that would be able to land me my dream job

			<p id="aboutMe">
			All business aside, I’m an adult in the making and a fur mom to a crazy Husky pup and Norwegian Forest Cat (yes, I learned my cat’s breed). I enjoy learning new things, keeping myself busy with DIY projects, pointlessly surfing the web and sharing countless of memes, chasing and cleaning after my wild Husky pup, and spending time with my fiance, his family, and mine. The best days are when I’m relaxed on my couch while I watch my fiance play and rage at video games. I like to explore and see new places so traveling all over the world is on my bucket list.
